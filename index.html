<h3>Notes / Miscellaneous</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="Pol van Hoften - Introduction to the Emerton-Gee stack.pdf">Introduction to the Emerton-Gee stack. </a> These are the notes from the first talk in the Stanford--Berkeley number theory learning seminar on the Emerton-Gee stack of the fall of 2022. 
       
  </li>     
  <li> <a href="Pol van Hoften - Moduli of Langlands parameters study group first talk.pdf">Introduction to moduli spaces of local Langlands parameters. </a>  These are the notes from the first talk in the identically named Stanford--Berkeley number theory learning seminar in the spring of 2022.
       
  </li>
   
  <li><a href="Pol van Hoften - Higher Coleman Theory Talk.pdf">Higher Coleman Theory </a>: These are the notes from two talks I gave in the London number theory study group in the fall of 2020, attempting to summarise the recent identically named work of Boxer and Pilloni. The first part of the talk is a general introduction to their results and techniques, and in the second part of the talk I specialise to Siegel threefolds and make everything as explicit as possible. 
  </li>

  <li>
  <a href="Pol van Hoften - Construction of moduli schemes smooth case.pdf"> Construction of moduli schemes: smooth case</a>: These are the notes from a talk I gave in the LTXZZ study group at Imperial in Winter 2020, which discusses the following <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11942"> recent work</a> of Liu-Tian-Xiao-Zhang-Zhu. In the talk I start by discussing a baby case of what happens in Section 4 of the aforementioned paper and then discuss Section 4 in more detail.
  </li>
  <li>
  <a href="Pol van Hoften - Igusa Varieties.pdf"> Igusa Varieties & Mantovan's Formula</a>: These are the notes from a talk I gave in the London number theory study group in summer 2019. I briefly review the Newton stratification on the mod p fiber of a PEL type Shimura variety (with good reduction at p) and then introduce Oort's foliation. After giving some background on completely slope divisible Barsotti-Tate groups I define Igusa varieties and prove that they are &egrave;tale covers of the leaves of the foliation. I end by defining the `product structure' on the Newton strata, which is a finite surjective map from the product of an Igusa variety with a truncated Rapoport-Zink space to a Newton stratum.
  </li>  
  <li>
	<a href="Pol van Hoften - Perverse Sheaves.pdf">Perverse Sheaves and nearby cycles</a>: These are the notes from a talk I gave in the London number theory study group in fall 2018. I introduce the triangulated category of l-adic sheaves with constructible cohomology and discuss the six functor formalism in this context. I then define the perverse t-structure and talk about the intermediate extension functor. In the last section I discuss Milnor fibers, nearby cycles and discuss the fact that nearby cycles 'preserve perversity'.
	</li>
	<li>
	<a href="Pol van Hoften - Perfectoid rings and the pro-etale site (notes by James Newton).pdf">Perfectoid rings, A_inf, and the pro-&egrave;tale site</a>: These are the notes from a talk I give in the London number theory study group in summer 2018. The first half follows Section 3 of Bhatt-Morrow-Scholze and the second half is about the pro-&egrave;tale site of an adic space (notes by James Newton).
	</li>	
	<li>
	<a href="Pol van Hoften - Classical Motives.pdf">Classical Motives</a>: These are the notes from a talk I gave in the London number theory study group in spring 2018. I start by giving a quick introduction to intersection theory and then define various categories of Chow motives. I end by discussing the proof of Theorem 1 of Jannsen's paper <a href="https://epub.uni-regensburg.de/26642/1/jannsen10.pdf">Motives, numerical equivalence, and semi-simplicity</a>. 
	</li>	
    <li>
      <a href="Pol van Hoften - Mixed Complexes.pdf">Mixed Complexes</a>: These are the notes from a talk I gave in the <a href="https://www.math.ru.nl/personal/bmoonen/Seminars/PerverseSheaves.html">seminar on perverse sheaves </a> in the spring of 2017 in Nijmegen. I introduce the notion of weight for an l-adic sheaf and define pure and mixed sheaves. I then discuss the derived category of such mixed sheaves and its stability properties under the six operations. I end by proving Proposition 5.12 of Beilinson-Bernstein-Deligne.
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="Pol van Hoften - Descent of Morphisms.pdf">Descent of Morphisms</a>: These are the notes from a talk I gave for topics in algebraic geometry in Spring 2016 in Leiden.
